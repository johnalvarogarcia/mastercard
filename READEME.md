<h1>Forager Mastercard Cybersecurity Job Simulation</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Forager's Microsoft Cybersecurity course is a job simulation or 'virtual internship' in which we're tasked with analysing a phising email, then designing a simulated phising campaign to be used raise awareness of one of the most common threats organizations today face.

We then interpret the performance of the phishing email simulation to deliver phishing prevention training to the affected teams. 

In this simulation we learn:
<ul>
  <li>What threat phishing presents to an organization</li>
 <li>What different types of phishing emails look like</li>
 <li>How Mastercard prevents and mitigates phishing threats</li>
</ul>
<br />
